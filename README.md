### Project Description
Coding-breaking board game for one player. The player needs to guess the 4-color “secret code” in 10 rounds. After each guess, scoring pegs of different colors are used to show the player how many correct guesses they had got. Red pegs mean a correct color but out of position, black pegs mean a correct color in the correct position. These scoring pegs can be placed in any order – the player never knows which colors are correct and/or in the correct position.
