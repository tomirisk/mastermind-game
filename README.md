### Project Description
Coding-breaking board game for one player. The program selects the 4-color “secret code” out of a possible 6 colors. The player needs to guess which colors are in which positions in the secret code in 10 rounds. After each guess, scoring pegs of different colors are used to show them how many correct guesses and how many correct positions they had gotten with their guess. Red pegs mean a correct color but out of position, black pegs mean a correct color in the correct position. These scoring pegs can be placed in any order – the player never knows which colors are correct and/or in the correct position.
